                <p>Ryan is a visual artist and creative technologist from a deindustrialised town on the Welsh coast, where he was shaped by a deep connection to the natural world. Working across theatre, live events, and expanded cinema, he harnesses cutting-edge technology to craft experiences that challenge conventions and champion presence. His practice reflects a staunch belief in nature as both sustainer of life and healer of soul, envisioning a harmony between decentralised tech and the wild. In his spare time, Ryan is a writer and filmmaker, exploring stories that echo his roots and convictions.</p>
                <p>Ryan is a graduate of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama</p>
