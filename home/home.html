                <p>Ryan Samuel Davies is a visual artist, creative technologist, and filmmaker from a deindustrialised town on the Welsh coast, where a deep connection to the natural world continues to shape his practice. Specialising in video design, projection mapping, interactive media, and audio production, he creates immersive experiences for theatre, live events, installation art, expanded cinema, and independent music. Ryan crafts work that challenges conventions, champions presence, and envisions a harmony between decentralised tech and the wild, viewing nature as both sustainer of life and healer of the soul. In his spare time, he writes and makes films that echo his roots and convictions.</p>
                <p>Ryan graduated from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama with a BA (Hons) in Video Design for Live Performance.</p>
